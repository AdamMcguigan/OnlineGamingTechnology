Current issue when third player joins the game, The colors will start flickering We have figured out what the issue is but were not able to fix it. When the third player joins the ID's of the players get mixed up so player 0 and player 2 get the same ID.
The correct ID's are sent from the server and are initialised properly to the players, it all goes wrong after that. 
If one of the players leave the colours stop flickering and the game acts normal again.
